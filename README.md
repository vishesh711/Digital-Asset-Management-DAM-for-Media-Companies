# Digital Asset Management (DAM) for Media Companies

A comprehensive Digital Asset Management platform designed for media companies to efficiently store, manage, and distribute digital assets with multi-tenant architecture.

## Why This Project is Necessary

In today's digital-first world, media companies face significant challenges managing their growing libraries of digital content:

- **Content Chaos**: Without a DAM, files are scattered across drives, cloud services, and personal computers, making it impossible to find what you need when you need it.

- **Version Confusion**: Teams waste time using outdated assets or recreating files that already exist because there's no single source of truth.

- **Rights Management Risks**: Using assets after license expiration or in unauthorized ways can lead to expensive legal consequences.

- **Inefficient Collaboration**: Without proper asset organization, teams struggle to share files efficiently, leading to bottlenecks in production workflows.

- **Missed Monetization**: Valuable assets remain underutilized because they can't be found, tracked, or packaged for different revenue streams.

## How This Project Solves These Problems

Our Digital Asset Management solution addresses these challenges through:

- **Centralized Repository**: All digital assets are stored in one secure, searchable system, making content instantly findable.

- **Intelligent Organization**: AI-powered tagging and custom metadata make searching intuitive, with advanced filtering to find exactly what you need.

- **Rights Tracking**: Built-in license management prevents unauthorized use and sends alerts before licenses expire.

- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Different brands or departments maintain separate, secure environments while sharing infrastructure.

- **Seamless Distribution**: Easily publish assets to websites, social media, and other platforms with proper formatting.

- **Monetization Tools**: Package and license content for different uses, tracking usage and automating royalty calculations.

## System Architecture

The DAM system consists of the following key components:

- **Core DAM System**: Central asset storage, metadata management, and version control
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Isolated environments for different media companies
- **User Access Management**: Admin portal, brand portals, partner access, and mobile apps
- **Authentication**: Role-based access control and SSO integration
- **AI Services**: Auto-tagging and content recognition capabilities
- **Rights Management**: Licensing workflows, rights tracking, and expiration alerts
- **Distribution**: Multi-channel publishing for various platforms
- **Analytics**: Usage tracking and royalty calculations
- **Asset Processing**: Transcoding and format conversion
- **Monetization**: Licensing marketplace and revenue management

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Node.js/Express for API services
- GraphQL for the API gateway
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Elasticsearch for search functionality
- Object Storage (S3-compatible) for asset storage
- Redis for caching
- Authentication with JWT and OAuth

### Frontend
- React.js for SPA interfaces
- Redux for state management
- Material UI for theming
- Apollo Client for GraphQL integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
